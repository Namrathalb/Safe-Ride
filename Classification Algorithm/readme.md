*Road anomalies* can include potholes, speed-breakers or just any other abnormality on roads.

An efficient method to detect such anomalies can be through an accelerometer. An accelerometer is a device used to measure acceleration forces in the x y and z directions. 

The idea is to measure acceleration in x y and z directions and recognize peaks in order to detect harsh movement of the vehicle. 

Accelerometer data combined with GPS CO ORDINATEs can be of great benefit. The huge collection of data acquired can help us understand how the anomalies affect automobiles and how drivers react to such anomalies.
